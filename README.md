# Brain Tumor Classification Project

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to develop an AI-based classification system that classifies brain tumors based on CT scan images.

## Methodology
This project utilizes **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** to develop the model, which will be integrated into an application with an accessible user interface (UI).

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project:  
[Kaggle - Brain Tumor Classification (MRI)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri/data)
